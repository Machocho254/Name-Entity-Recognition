# Name-Entity-Recognition
This is a ML project employing NLP 

## NAMED ENTITY
Named Entity means anything that is a real-world object such as a person, a place, any organisation, any product which has a name.

For example, I am Machocho and I am a Machine Learning Engineer. In this example;

Machocho is a named entity of the person.
Machine Learning is the named entity of the field/subject.
Engineer is a named entity of the profession.

## NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
In machine learning, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an NLP task to identify the named entities in a given text. Grammarly uses this algorithm when correcting and hence recognizes this. Autocorrect in smartphones and computers also use the same technology when making correction to texts.

## NEURAL NETWORKS 
LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) networks are an extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) mainly introduced to handle situations where RNNs fail.
